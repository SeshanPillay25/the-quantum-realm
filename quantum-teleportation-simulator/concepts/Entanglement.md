# Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a unique phenomenon in quantum mechanics where the quantum states of two or more particles become interdependent. When particles are entangled, the state of one particle is directly related to the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This seemingly instantaneous connection between entangled particles puzzled even Albert Einstein, who referred to it as "spooky action at a distance."

## Overview of Quantum Entanglement

Entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in many quantum computing applications, including quantum teleportation. In an entangled system, the particles cannot be described independently, and their joint state is described by a single, composite wave function. Measuring the state of one entangled particle causes the wave function to collapse, revealing the state of the other particle.

It's important to note that quantum entanglement does not allow for faster-than-light communication or the transmission of classical information. The correlation between entangled particles arises from the shared quantum state rather than any instantaneous exchange of information.

## The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Teleportation

In the process of quantum teleportation, entanglement serves as the communication channel between the source qubit (Alice) and the target qubit (Bob). Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, usually in a Bell state. The quantum state of Alice's qubit is then transferred to Bob's qubit through a series of quantum operations and measurements, with the help of classical communication.

Quantum entanglement is essential for quantum teleportation, as it allows the state of the source qubit to be "teleported" to the target qubit without physically moving the qubit itself. The entangled qubits act as a bridge, enabling the transmission of quantum information between Alice and Bob.

## Creating Entangled Qubits

Entangled qubits can be created by applying specific quantum gates to an initial state. One common way to generate an entangled pair of qubits is by creating a Bell state. A Bell state is formed by applying a Hadamard gate to one qubit followed by a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target.

The resulting state is an entangled state of the two qubits, with the following form:

(|00> + |11>) / sqrt(2)

This state represents a maximally entangled pair of qubits, where measuring the state of one qubit immediately determines the state of the other.

In the context of quantum teleportation, entangled qubits provide the foundation for transferring quantum information between distant qubits, opening up new possibilities for secure communications and quantum computing.
